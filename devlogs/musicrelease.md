The Sapling main theme music available
======================================

| Announcement | Music |

In this first devlog I announce the official release of the main theme sheet music, along with the sheet music and its separate layers.

Today, the main theme of The Sapling was officially released on SoundCloud. It's an attempt to mix an ambient music like sound with a recognizable melody - and if you listen carefully, you will indeed recognize this same melody throughout the game. Have a listen:

Because I would very much like to encourage covers and remixes of this material, I also release sheet music and the separate layers of music used in the main theme.

To further encourage other people playing with the material, __I will hand out free Steam keys for every serious cover and remix attempt__ . E-mail me at thesaplinggame@gmail.com .
