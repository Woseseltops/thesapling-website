Six 3D models that explain the deep evolution simulation in The Sapling
=======================================================================

| Graphics |

I am releasing six models created by playtesters of The Sapling on Sketchfab, using the plant and animal builders. Several bodyparts are annotated so you get an idea of how deep the simulation in The Sapling really is.

As the release date of The Sapling is coming closer, it's time to give you some more insight in the game. Therefore, I am releasing six models created by playtesters of The Sapling, using the plant and animal builders. They can be looked at from all sides, or they can be downloaded to incorporate them in your own 3D creations.

One thing I noticed from the responses to the 'First look' video is that it was not clear to everybody how deep the simulation really is. Therefore, I have used Sketchfab's annotation functionality to highlight various bodyparts of the organisms displayed, and explain a bit on how they impact the simulation.
