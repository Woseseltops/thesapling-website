Breakdown of the visual style of The Sapling
============================================

Writing game code and creating game graphics are two fundamentally different beasts. One area where this becomes frustratingly clear, is when you're inspired by another game and want to see if you can replicate a particular idea. If I encounter a game mechanic that I like, I can do a quick internet search and the result is most likely a tutorial on how to build this kind of technology. If I like the graphics in a game, on the other hand, there's not much I can do other than endlessly combining effects I already know and hope this by chance achieves the graphical style I was trying to reproduce.

In this article I'd like to show you it doesn't have to be this way; I'll set a good example and show you in detail how to achieve the visual style of The Sapling.

Whereas I code with a clear goal in mind and confidence I can make it (this is often overconfidence, but only rarely does a quick internet search not provide the answer) as long as I have the time to step by step approach my goal, creating graphics is much more like endlessly throwing things at the wall and see what sticks. I only know what I wanted once I see it, and I'm unsure if I'll ever reach my goal until I reach it. Or to make the difference more concrete:
