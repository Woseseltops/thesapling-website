LEAD

This is a short excerpt of what the music in The Sapling sounds like. I hesitated a long time before I settled on this musical style. Normally, I prefer memorable, hummable melodies over soundscapes, but for The Sapling I couldn't figure how this would work. This was mainly for two reasons: firstly, every melody I came up with didn't really seem to match with the rest of game's style. Many other simulation games feature either jazzy or bright and jumpy orchestral soundtracks, but both styles somehow seemed to clash with a more serious game about nature. Secondly, I was afraid that I simply would not be able to come up with enough material, meaning that the same melodies would be repeating over and over.

The solution came from an unexpected direction: during experimentation with ambient background music to get into a more productive mood (didn't work for me), I noticed that they often used a slideshow of pretty nature photos as 'background visuals'. Would it also work the other way around? If nature makes a good background visual for ambient music, is ambient music good background music for nature visuals? Accepting this, and thus giving up hummable melodies, was a slow process, but ultimately lead to a second discovery: a lot of ambient music rarely changes chords. Instead, all notes throughout the whole ambient piece are from the same musical scale. This is convenient, because a general (and oversimplified) rule of thumb is that two pieces of music that use notes from the same scale will always sound good together. Creating an ambient sounding procedural soundtrack could simply be a matter of creating a large pool of musical fragments that only use notes from the same scale, and mixing them at random. How well this works is exemplified by the project (http://inbflat.net)['In B Flat'] (which, as the name suggests, use B Flat as this one scale).

In other words, this idea solved my two problems in one go: (1) the genre of ambient music fit the game's feel and (2) I could endlessly combine small musical fragments, giving you a fresh sounding soundtrack every time. The result is available for you to play with below. Feel free to click some play buttons at random, and decide for yourself if you think they sound good together.

It might be a matter of personal preference, 

was that although everything indeed sounded good together, some combinations sounded a lot better than others. In the end, I identified four categories of fragments:

* The background, with long, sleepy tones. These are what gives the music its ambient feel. Strings are the most typical example.
* The foreground, played by a single instrument with short notes, grabbing the listener's attention. I most often use the *** and the piano for this.
* The color, which is somewhere in between: they are played by a single instrument, but use long notes. These give a bit of flavour to a background that would otherwise always sound similar. This can for example be a clarinet or a ***.
* The bass, often played by double bases or base clarinets.

Furthermore, I discovered that a trick I knew from writing more epic film style music, using strings in *unisono* (playing the low and high versions of the same note at the same time), also worked here to give the mix a more epic feel. In the end, I used this together with the base as the players is looking at his/her creations from a distance: as the player zooms out, the bass and *unisono* fade in.

[Label fragments and add unisono layer]

The button above categorizes the fragments, and for the fragments in the background category adds an option to 'switch on' the epic version. If you make sure that for every category only one fragment is playing, you get something really similar to what plays during the game.

I still managed to squeeze one recurring melody in the game, though: the main theme.
