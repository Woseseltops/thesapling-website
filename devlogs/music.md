I hesitated for a long time before I settled on the musical style of The Sapling. Normally, I prefer memorable, hummable melodies over soundscapes, but for The Sapling I couldn't figure how this would work. What kind of melody should it be? What feeling should it convey? How do I prevent this melody from becoming repetitive? 

I am constantly doing small experiments with my working habits to see if I can improve my productivity, and it was around that time that I was experimenting with ambient background tracks. 

--- Why talk about leitmotifs when there are none? ---

For both movie and videogame music, I really like the idea of leitmotifs. Leitmotifs are melodies that occur multiple times and are linked to concepts within the movie or game (like a character or a place). They can for example appear when these concepts are mentioned and appear on screen, and can change along with them. 

Unfortunately, I realized early in the project that leitmotifs didn't really work with The Sapling, and most other games in the simulation genre: in simulation games, you create the characters and places yourself - that's why it is my favourite genre - so they are not known to the composer beforehand. 

. I still managed to squeeze one recurring melody in the game, though: the main theme.
