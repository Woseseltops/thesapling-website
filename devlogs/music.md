I hesitated for a long time before I settled on the musical style of The Sapling. Normally, I prefer memorable, hummable melodies over soundscapes, but for The Sapling I couldn't figure how this would work. This was mainly for two reasons: firstly, every melody I came up with didn't really seem to match with the rest of game's style. Many other simulation games feature either jazzy or bright and jumpy orchestral soundtracks, but both styles somehow seemed to clash with a more serious game about nature. Secondly, I was afraid that I simply would not be able to come up with enough material, meaning that the same melodies would be repeating over and over.

The answer came from an unexpected direction. I am constantly doing small experiments with my working habits to see if I can improve my productivity, and it was around that time that I was experimenting with ambient background music. In practice, this meant searching for the word 'ambient' on YouTube, picking a random video, and then minimize the browser. While these videos didn't really get me into the right mood (more relaxed then productive), I did notice that they often used a slideshow of pretty nature photos. Ambient music and nature games might be a good fit.

As I slowly started to accept that this game would not be my opportunity to write the ultimate memorable melody to conquer the world and started researching ambient music, I discovered another thing: ambient music rarely changes musical chords. A general (and oversimplified) rule of thumb is that two pieces of music using notes from the same chords will sound good together. This meant that I could collect an endless amount of musical fragments and they would all mash well, provided that they were all built from the same chords. How well this works is exemplified by the project (http://inbflat.net)['In B Flat'].

In other words, the genre of ambient music did not only fit the game's feel, it also solved my second problem: I could endlessly combine small musical fragments, giving you a fresh sounding soundtrack every time. This is in many ways similar to how small development teams often invest in building a good random level generator (I'm thinking of games like Minecraft, Spelunky or FTL) to prevent having to built a large amount of levels by hand. Anyway, once a solution to one problem also starts solving other problems, it is usually the Right one, so I implemented a prototype to see if it would work. The result is what you see below. Feel free to click some play buttons at random, and decide for yourself if you think they sound good together.

The result for me was that although everything indeed sounded good together, some combinations sounded a lot better than others. In the end, I identified four categories of fragments:

* The background, with long, sleepy tones. These are what gives the music its ambient feel. Strings are the most typical example.
* The foreground, played by a single instrument with short notes, grabbing the listener's attention. I most often use the *** and the piano for this.
* The color, which is somewhere in between: they are played by a single instrument, but use long notes. These give a bit of flavour to a background that would otherwise always sound similar. This can for example be a clarinet or a ***.
* The bass, often played by double bases or base clarinets.

Furthermore, I discovered that a trick I knew from writing more epic film style music, using strings in *unisono* (playing the low and high versions of the same note at the same time), also worked here to give the mix a more epic feel. In the end, I used this together with the base as the players is looking at his/her creations from a distance: as the player zooms out, the bass and *unisono* fade in.

[Label fragments and add unisono layer]

The button above categorizes the fragments, and for the fragments in the background category adds an option to 'switch on' the epic version. If you make sure that for every category only one fragment is playing, you get something really similar to what plays during the game.

I still managed to squeeze one recurring melody in the game, though: the main theme.
