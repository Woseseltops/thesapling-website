What happens when you let evolution simulator The Sapling run for 1 week continuously
=====================================================================================

1. Mooiste beelden, bouwdingen van the trailer
----------------------------------------------
* This is evolution simulator The Sapling, a game where you design your own ecosystem of plants and animals. 
* Recently released the flower update, which among other things adds flowers and bioluminescence.
* Favourite part of the game is that you can turn on random mutations, which means that every newborn plant or animal gets something randomly changed to it, which might make it more succesful or not, which is of course how evolution works
* To showcase the flower update a bit, I decided to livestream the evolution simulator continuously for 1 week, in the beginning of september. 
* This is what happened

Scene 1: empty world, show starter animals with DoF with fake stream start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This the basic starter plant I used
* This is the basic starter animal I used
* In the beginning, you see usually rapid changes and diversification to fill all niches, and this is exactly what happened.

Scene 2: flying over colorful flowers
-------------------------------------
* In one day, lots of colorful flowers have evolved already. 
* Of course exaclty what I wanted, given I was showcasing the flower update, but several tests showed the chances of this happening are small, because plants first need to develop pollination at all, animals need to discover they can eat the nectar, and then plants need to take advantage of moving the pollen on the animals body.
* All of this happened litterally overnight

Scene 3: DoF various plants with needles
----------------------------------------
 * While there is lots of variation in the flowers, so far all plants have the same type of leaves: needles. As a result, they only grow in the colder areas of the world.

Scene 4: flying over fat plants, DoF a number of fat species with various colors in checkpoint 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* On the second day already something important happened: a fat plant species emerged, somewhere in the east of the world, that was wildly successful. Almost all of the successfull plants species after that would descend from this one, and as a result, there would be lots of fat plants.

Scene 5: DoF plants with long necks
-----------------------------------
* Something similar happened to the animals, although the results were less extreme.
* where weird looking animals with long necks evolved the strongest, so they could collect food faster

Scene 6: DoF animals with tubes
-------------------------------
* After 2 days
* Long snouts specialized for eating nectar have entered the scene! Some of the more successful animals are now relying on nectar only (which is not a bad idea at all, given that almost all plants have some form of flower).
* I was a bit afraid that a strong, wind pollinated species might take over, with all of these animals going extinct as a result of that, but thankfully that never happened.

Scene 7: show cold and warm areas in the map
--------------------------------------------
* So far, all plants still had needles, and they were more or less trapped in the colder areas of the map.
* There was an area on the other side of the map that would have been good for them as well, but because they couldn't pass the desert in the middle, they never reached it.

Scene 8: flying over species in warmer area, DoF various plants without needles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* but after 3 days one plant with other leaves emerged with other leaves. Because there was so much empty space with, quickly became extremely succesful and you again see rapid diversification
* This is really where the golden age of these fat plants start
* And as before, it must have been a very fat plant where this mutation happened, because all the descendants were fat species as well
* The two necessary mutations were another kind of leaf, and a heat resistant type of flowers

Scene 9
-------
* As the current ecosystem has stabilized around animals eating nectar, plants don't need to worry about leaves getting eaten, and as a result don't grow higher. If anything, they seem to be getting fatter. 

Scene 10
--------
* A final interesting thing that happened is that once the plants reached the other kind of the desert, the heat resistant flower was no longer the only option, and you see rapid diversification in flower typed. Among other things, they developed bioluminescence to attract animals.
* This made a lot of the animal migrate north, leaving the once very populous south now near empty in terms of animals. As a result, some species of plants dropped the flowers and relied on wind pollination again

End scene: blur
