What happens when you let evolution simulator The Sapling run for 1 week continuously
=====================================================================================

1. Mooiste beelden, bouwdingen van the trailer
----------------------------------------------
* This is evolution simulator The Sapling, a game where you design your own ecosystem of plants and animals. 
* Recently released the flower update, which among other things adds flowers and bioluminescence.
* Favourite part of the game is that you can turn on random mutations, which means that every newborn plant or animal gets something randomly changed to it, which might make it more succesful or not, which is of course how evolution works
* To showcase the flower update a bit, I decided to livestream the evolution simulator for 7 continuous days. 
* This is a summary of that 1 week livestream

Scene 1: empty world, show starter animals with DoF
----------------------------------------------------
* This the basic starter plant I used
* This is the basic starter animal I used
* In the beginning, you see usually rapid changes and diversification to fill all niches, and this is exactly what happened.

Scene 2: flying over colorful flowers
--------------------------------------
* Wow lots of colorful flowers have evolved already. 
* Of course exaclty what I wanted, given I was showcasing the flower update, but several tests showed the chances of this happening are small, because plants first need to develop pollination at all, animals need to discover they can eat the nectar, and then plants need to take advantage of moving the pollen on the animals body.

Scene 3: DoF various plants with needles
----------------------------------------
 * While there is lots of variation in the flowers, so far all plants have the same type of leaves: needles. As a result, they only grow in the colder areas of the world.

Scene 4: flying over fat plants, DoF a number of fat species with various colors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* On the second day already something important happened: a fat plant species emerged that was wildly successful. Almost all of the successfull plants species after that would descend from this one, and as a result, there would be lots of fat plants.

Scene 5: DoF plants with long necks
-----------------------------------
* Something similar happened to the animals, although the results were less extreme.
* where weird looking animals with long necks were successfully.

Scene 6: DoF animals with tubes
-------------------------------
* After 2 days
* Long snouts specialized for eating nectar have entered the scene! Some of the more successful animals are now relying on nectar only (which is not a bad idea at all, given that almost all plants have some form of flower).

Scene 7: show cold and warm areas in the map
--------------------------------------------
* So far, all plants still had needles, and they were more or less trapped in the colder areas of the map

Scene 8: flying over species in warmer area, DoF various plants without needles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* but after 3 days one plant with other leaves emerged with other leaves. Because there was so much empty space with, quickly became extremely succesful and you again see rapid diversification
* And as before, it must have been a very fat plant where this mutation happened, because all the descendants were fat species as well

Scene 9
-----------------
* As the current ecosystem has stabilized around animals eating nectar, plants don't need to worry about leaves getting eaten, and as a result don't grow higher. If anything, they seem to be getting fatter. 

End scene: blur
