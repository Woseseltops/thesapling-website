  <title>How player content works in The Sapling</title>
  <description>The Sapling was built from the ground up with community interaction in mind. This interaction goes both ways: players can take stuff generated by or for the game, and use it in their own creations, or they can add their own creations to the game. </description>

  <title>Procedural animation in the Sapling</title>
  <description>We're standing on the side of a highway in Budapest, trying to hitch a ride. I'm elegantly dressed for a proper afternoon at the National Gallery in a green embroidered dress and a knotted cotton scarf. Jeff appears to have just walked off the set of a western shot in Brooklyn. His grandfather's 1950s Stetson, cocked lazily to the side, is accompanied by a pair of fiery red chinos and a striped navy sweater.</description>
